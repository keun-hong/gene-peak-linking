# Code for correlation-based gene-peak linking analysis
Integrating the activity of regulatory elements with gene expression is essential for understanding how the genome operates. Therefore, pairing genes that are expressed (as shown by RNA-seq) with peaks identified from ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, etc., is important.
Here, I have uploaded Python code that performs a correlation-based gene-peak linking analysis. The method of analysis is derived from [MR Corces et al., Science 2018](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav1898)<br>
