# Code for correlation-based gene-peak linking analysis
Integrating the activity of regulatory elements with gene expression is essential to understand how the genome is operated. So, it's important to pair the genes expressed (RNA-seq) and peaks called from ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.
Here, I uploaded a Python code performing correlation-based gene-peak linking analysis.
The analysis method is derived from [MR Corces et al., Science 2018](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav1898).<br>
